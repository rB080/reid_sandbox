# Some tips:

You can find conda environment yml files in ```\environments```. Feel free to install them using:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Also, if you have set up some environment and want to export them as yml, please deactivate any existing environments and run the following inside ```\environments```:

```
bash export_env.sh <DESIRED_CONDA_ENV_NAME>
```

Thanks!
